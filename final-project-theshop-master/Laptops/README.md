## Tasks
- Updated the Layout with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to populate content into 'laptops.html' & 'laptop-info.html' pages with the help of arrays and make it responsive

- Created a new file 'laptop-info.html', content is populated through an array in the JavaScript file. Hence no need of 01.html-06.html pages, so those are removed

- Added Sort by 'Low to High Price', 'High to Low Price' & 'Customer Reviews' feature in: 
    - 'laptops.html' file

- Added some content in:
    - 'laptops.html', 'laptop-info.html' & 'contact.html' files

- Removed unwanted image assets in:
    - 'assets/img' folder

    - 'assets/js/script.js' file

- Added some styles in:
    - 'assets/css/main.css' file 
    - 'assets/css/queries.css' file 

## Learning curve and challenges
- Populating the content with the help of array & adding Sorting feature to it, was a hard part in the project but I learnt it well and used it in my web pages
